Solving [cryptopals](https://cryptopals.com) cryptography challenges using python.

Code is written as a package with test cases representing the specific challenges. The goal is to end up with a library of cryptographic tests that can be reused on software other than these challenges.

Weak cryptographic algorithms are accessed through ctypes and a wrapper library that in turn makes use of the deprecated OpenSSL 1.1.
